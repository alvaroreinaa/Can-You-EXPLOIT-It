# Can You EXPLOIT It
The tool is a web application that displays an inventory of exploits according to the search performed by the user using different parameters.
The main difference with _exploitdb_ or _searchsploit_ (the tool from which it obtains the exploits), is that, in addition to the searches that can be made in these, it also allows you to search by:
 - Vendor of the target software.
 - Link of the target software.
 - Version of the target software.
 - Where the exploit has been tested (which scenario).
 - CVE.

This functionality has been implemented by me and is done by searching for keywords in the exploit itself. Most exploits that are currently uploaded to _exploitdb_ follow a scheme of information from which you can retrieve all the necessary fields, but it is true that from X date of antiquity, do not follow it, so that, or not retrieve the information, or retrieve it in a wrong way (other content that has that keyword). This accuracy will be improved.

### Requisites üìã
For the correct use of the tool, you will need a series of software already installed with its corresponding configuration. This section must be carried out by the user. The steps to follow are:
* **Running the tool on a supported operating system:** Currently the tool is supported and tested on __Linux__ and __Ubuntu__.
* **Internet connection available:** Software will be installed during _setup.py_.
* **Python 3.9 or higher installed:** Not having this version will trigger execution problems. You can install it using the following command: `sudo apt-get install python3`
* **Have MySQL properly installed, configured (listed below), and running as a service:** Depending on the version of your operating system, you will have to install MySQL in one way or another. After that, you have to create a user in which the database of the tool will be created and the information will be stored in it. The steps to follow are:
  - _Log as MySQL root_: `mysql -u root -p` 
  - _Create the user_: `CREATE USER 'user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';`
  - _Grant privileges_: `GRANT ALL privileges ON *.* TO user@localhost identified by 'password';`
  - _Flush privileges_: `FLUSH PRIVILEGES;`
* **Install the necessary python dependencies:** In order to run the _setup.py_ and the rest of the code, you need to install the dependencies found in _requirements.txt_. To do this, run the following command where the file is located: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Setup üõ†Ô∏è
Once the above has been done, you can run the _setup.py_ file. This file will install the dependencies and additional software that the tool needs to work:
* _Searchsploit tool._
* _Nodejs and npm._
* _Node modules._

Run the following command where the file is located:
```
python3 setup.py
```
During installation, you will be requested for the corresponding MySQL user and password previously created, in order to initialize the database with the exploits available in the version of Searchsploit just installed.

Finally, in the _main.routes.js_ file (located in the _routes_ folder) in the top of the file, the user and password _const_ should be changed to the previously created one. In this way, you will not be asked for this information again while using the tool.

</p>

### Execution ‚öôÔ∏è
_**Important:** Always check that the mysql service is started before using the tool. You can do that with the following command: `mysql service status`_. If it is off or stopped, execute the following command: `service mysql start`

To run the tool, execute the following command in the root folder:
```
node app.js
```
And browse to: http://localhost:3000/

### How the tool works :mag_right:
Once we access the above URL, we will see the following:

</p>

The main page will be displayed. Here we can enter the data we want in the different parameters to perform the search that best suits our objective:

</p>

When the search is performed, all the exploits matching the search will be displayed in a scrollable table, with all their respective associated data.

</p>

To update the _Searchsploit_ tool and our database with its new exploits, just click on the _"Update Database"_ button. As we will see on the screen, we will have to look at the shell in which we have executed the command to start the server. This is because we will probably be asked for the computer's password to be able to update _Searchsploit_ to the latest version.

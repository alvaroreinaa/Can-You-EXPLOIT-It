# Can You EXPLOIT It
The tool is a web application that displays an inventory of exploits with information about them and their associated exploitation processes according to the search performed by the user.

### Requisites üìã
For the correct operation of the tool you will need a series of software already installed with its corresponding configuration. This section must be carried out by the user. The steps to follow are:
* **Running the tool on a supported operating system:** Currently the tool is supported and tested on __Linux__ and __Ubuntu__.
* **Internet connection available:** Programs will be installed during _setup.py_.
* **Python 3.9 or higher installed:** Not having this version will trigger execution problems. You can install it using the following command: `sudo apt-get install python3`
* **Have MySQL properly installed, configured (listed below), and running as a service:** Depending on the version of your operating system, you will have to install MySQL in one way or another.  After that, you have to create a user in which the database of the tool will be created and the information will be stored in it. The steps to follow are:
  - _Log as MySQL root_: `mysql -u root -p` 
  - _Create the user_: `CREATE USER 'user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';`
  - _Grant privileges_: `GRANT ALL privileges ON *.* TO user@localhost identified by 'password';`
  - _Flush privileges_: `FLUSH PRIVILEGES;`
* **Install the necessary python dependencies:** In order to run the _setup.py_ and the rest of the code, you need to install the dependencies found in _requirements.txt_. To do this, run the following command where the file is located: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Setup üõ†Ô∏è
Once the above has been done, you can run the _setup.py_ file. This file will install the dependencies and additional software that the tool needs to work:
* _Searchsploit tool._
* _Nodejs y npm._
* _Node modules._

Run the following command where the file is located:
```
python3 setup.py
```
During installation, you will be requested for the corresponding MySQL user and password previously created, in order to initialize the database with the exploits available in the version of Searchsploit just installed.

Finally, in the _main.routes.js_ file (located in the _routes_ folder) in the top of the file, the user and password _const_ should be changed to the previously created one. In this way, you will not be asked for this information again while using the tool.

</p>

### Execution ‚öôÔ∏è
_**Important:** Always check that the mysql service is started before using the tool._

To run the tool, execute the following command in the root of the tool:
```
node app.js
```
And browse to: http://localhost:3000/
